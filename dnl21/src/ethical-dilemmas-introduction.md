## The definition of a moral dilemma

>« Ethical dilemmas are situations in which an agent stands under two (or more) conflicting ethical requirements, none of which overrides the other. Two ethical requirements are conflicting if the agent can do one or the other but not both: the agent has to choose one over the other. Two conflicting ethical requirements do not override each other if they have the same strength or if there is no sufficient ethical reason to choose one over the other. Only this type of situation constitutes an ethical dilemma in the strict philosophical sense, often referred to as a genuine ethical dilemma. Other cases of ethical conflicts are resolvable and are therefore not ethical dilemmas strictly speaking. This applies to many instances of conflict of interest as well. For example, a businessman hurrying along the shore of a lake to a meeting is in an ethical conflict when he spots a drowning child close to the shore. But this conflict is not a genuine ethical dilemma since it has a clear resolution: jumping into the water to save the child significantly outweighs the importance of making it to the meeting on time. » (Source : [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethical_dilemma#Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethical_dilemma#Definition))
